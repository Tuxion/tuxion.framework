# Tuxion Framework 0.1

## Description

These are the beginnings of what's going to be a framework to develop advanced
web-applications with. It will have a robust MVC framework written in PHP on the
serverside, focussing on routing, permissions and an API friendly to the programmer.
It will have a simple yet strong Javascript/jQuery framework on the clientside, offering
an API which simplifies communication with the server and creating clientside MVC
structures.
